# TSP

This is a general framework to solve TSP problems including data manager, specific algorithms and tools for visualization. 

Algorithms covered in this framework includes: 
* Plain Local Search
* Varibale Local Search
* Simulated Annealing
* Genetic Algorithm

As for visualization, the connection layouts would be displayed in a planar graph and could further generate GIF to show process of covergence dynamically.
